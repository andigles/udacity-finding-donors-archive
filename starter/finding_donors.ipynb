    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",

One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`:\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most `$50,000`, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than `$50,000`. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than `$50,000`\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than `$50,000`, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "**Accuracy** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Precision** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives (words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives (all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\text{Precision} = \\frac{\\text{True Positives}} {\\text{True Positives} + \\text{False Positives}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Recall (sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives (words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\text{Recall} = \\frac{\\text{True Positives}} {\\text{True Positives} + \\text{False Negatives}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions, like in our case, for example, if we had 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the remaining 98 weren't, accuracy is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam (including the 2 that were spam, but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam (all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score and the weighted average (harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean when dealing with ratios)."

    "Considering possible computational restrictions, performance and fast convergence, I decided to select the best three models considering the following: A robust model with some computational needs but with a possible great performance; a good baseline model which mean, fast and reliable; and one that shares the characteristics of these both worlds, always of course trying to get the best metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Having this in mind I select:\n",
    "##### AdaBoost (Ensemble method) (Top performer candidate)\n",
    "- Describe one real-world application in industry where the model can be applied.\t\n",
    "\tAdaBoost can be used in network intrusion detection systems (John et al., 2024). In this example Principal Component Analysis was combined with AdaBoost to compensate PCA's deficiency in feature selection by minimizing the exponential loss function. Even though other methods showed better performance it still shows the potential of AdaBoost as an ensemble algorithm in this type of applications.\n",
    "\t\n",
    "- What are the strengths of the model; when does it perform well?\t\n",
    "\t- Focuses on difficult examples: Since in each round AdaBoost increases the weight of misclassified samples, the next weak learner will concentrate more on this misclassified points. This mean it can perform well when there's low label noise and there are \"genuine\" misclassified points.\n",
    "\t- Improve weak learners significantly: Since each learner adds a small, targeted correction to the ensemble, stacking these corrections translates into a very defined nonlinear decision function. It can have good performance just by having a base learner performing better than chance.\n",
    "\t- Reduces bias while keeping variance moderate: The idea of boosting is to attack underfitting. The model would add complexity only where needed.\n",
    "\t- Implicit feature selection: Since in each round the idea is to choose the most discriminative split, informative features tend to be reused while weak ones might not appear. This create the idea of selecting influential features while training. It could be helpful if we expect our dataset to have only a subset of futures that are truly influential.\n",
    "\n",
    "- What are the weaknesses of the model; when does it perform poorly?\n",
    "\t- Sensitive to noise and outliers: AdaBoost add weight to every misclassified sample. Mislabeled points or extreme outliers can bende the boundaries toward noise. If there are too many non-trivial label errors or many outliers it can perform poorly.\n",
    "\t- Requires careful tuning: Overly expressive weak learners can overfit, tiny steps with too few rounds can underfit. Balancing important hyperparameters like learning rate or number of estimators can be crucial.\n",
    "\n",
    "- What makes this model a good candidate for the problem, given what you know about the data?\n",
    "\tWith AdaBoost and shallow trees for example, we can reduce bias with the targeted correction approach. Focuses on hard cases and by adjusting class/instance weighting we can emphasize the class imbalance. It is a medium to high size dataset wit 45222 samples and 95 features after one-hot encoding so we need to be aware of the trade off by using conservative settings when tuning. It can be a robust choice for Finding Donors classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Logistic Regression (Fast, dependable baseline)\n",
    "- Describe one real-world application in industry where the model can be applied.\t\n",
    "\tConverso et al. (2023) uses a logistic regression model (together with a neural network model) to estimate the likelihood that a monitored machine will successfully complete a predefined workload, taking into account historical data from a machine's sensors and the impending workload. The logistic regression model here is used to assess the health condition of an equipment.\n",
    "\t\n",
    "- What are the strengths of the model; when does it perform well?\n",
    "\t- Interpretable: With logistic regression the model learns one weight per feature plus an intercept with each weight telling how changing that feature shifts the log-odds (and their probability) for the positive class. This allow us to explain the direction and magnitud in which a feature can affect our target/positive value.\n",
    "\t- Usable probabilities (Decision threshold): The model outputs a probability between 0 and 1. From there, we can set a decision threshold to match our goal. For example, to catch more positive values we can lower that threshold, to avoid false alarms we can higher it.\n",
    "\t- Efficient training with optimum solution: When fitting a logistic regression model the model doesn't get stuck in some local minima. Training is fast and memory efficient even with many samples or sparse features. It could be beneficial with a medium to large dataset with features mostly numeric or one-hot encoded without the need of heavy compute.\n",
    "\t \n",
    "- What are the weaknesses of the model; when does it perform poorly?\n",
    "\t- Underfitting on nonlinear problems: We logistic regression we assume the log-odds of the outcome is a linear combination of the features. If the relationship is actually expressed with non-linear/complex interactions between features the model can underfit.\n",
    "\t- Multicollinearity: When the features are strongly correlated (for example overlapping one hot dummies), coefficients become unstable which hurts interpretability and generalization. It would be important to be aware of the correlated features (drop/merge them), do dimensionality reduction or use regularization.\n",
    "\t- Sensitive to outliers: Extreme values can pull the boundary. With only a few positive, estimates can get noisy and uncertain.\n",
    "\t\n",
    "- What makes this model a good candidate for the problem, given what you know about the data?\n",
    "\tIt could work as a strong, practical baseline before using other heavier nonlinear models/ensembles. The medium-sized, tabular classification task of 45.222 samples with many sparse one hot features and already scaled numerical data is ideal for a regularized logistic model. Coefficients are interpretable which allows to to check on feature importance and selections for our target (in their magnitude and direction). With class_weight=\"balance\" we could address the 24.78% positive case of class imbalance.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Random Forest (Ensemble method) (balanced)\n",
    "- Describe one real-world application in industry where the model can be applied.\t\n",
    "\tRandom Forest classifier has been used in remote sensing (Belgiu & Drăguț, 2016) which is data with information about objects at or near the surface of Earth and atmosphere based on radiation reflected or emitted from those objects (Read & Torrado, 2009). During this work and as a conclusion they mention the virtues of RF classifier on being les sensitive than other machine learning classifier to the quality of training samples and to overfitting and they found it very suitable for classifying hyperspectral data with dimensionality and highly correlated data as a challenge.\n",
    "\t\n",
    "- What are the strengths of the model; when does it perform well?\t\n",
    "\t- Works well on clean data: When working with data where labels are mostly correct and features carry real signal, it means low label noise, the different trees would majorly agree on the same patterns meaning a strong generalization too.\n",
    "\t- Less sensitive to noise: When dealing with outliers or moderate noisy features their effect can be diluted by the averaging. The feature sampling part also prevents any single noisy feature from dominating each split.\n",
    "\t- Reduces variance through averaging: unless single decision trees, random forest decorrelate the features by training many decision trees on bootstrap samples and in a random subset of features on each split. It reduces variance and overfitting.\n",
    "\t- Feature importance can be obtained: We can obtain variability importance from the algorithm which can be very helpful when identifying which inputs drive predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- What are the weaknesses of the model; when does it perform poorly?\n",
    "\t- Computationally heavy: Random Forest algorithm trains and store many trees, depending on the number of samples, features and tres, memory can be an important aspect..\n",
    "\t- Less interpretable: in comparison to other models, like decision trees rules, Random forest losses that interpretability advantage. However it is still possible to get some feature importance through additional methods.\n",
    "\t- Imbalanced classes could be a problem: Majority vote can favor the prevalent class unless we adjust class weights or sampling.\n",
    "\t\n",
    "- What makes this model a good candidate for the problem, given what you know about the data?\n",
    "\tGiven the characteristics of the dataset (45222 records and 95 features after one-hot encoding) single decision trees could overfit and not generalize well. With Random Forest we can reduce variance and obtain a stable generalization while still capturing nonlinearities. It is a robust option to irrelevant noise and we can get, after some extra steps, the feature importance to understand the inputs that could drive predictions. To get better result we have the option to adjust class weight to handle the class imbalance in our dataset.\n",
